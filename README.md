# Bubbles
A visual demonstration of evolutionary learning in action. A variable population of bubbles are given a variable lifespan and are tasked with the job of getting to the end target. In order for the bubbles to learn from their mistakes, a typical genetic algorithm is implemented. This project was written using JavaScript, HTML, CSS and the p5.js library

Also, it has to be run in full-screen currently (I'm working on it!)

If you run it and it starts in windowed, refresh!
