Languages used: JavaScript, HTML, CSS

Libraries used: p5.js, Bootstrap

A visual demonstration of evolutionary learning in action. A variable population of bubbles are given a variable lifespan and are tasked with the job of getting to the end target (red circle). In order for the bubbles to learn from their mistakes, a typical genetic algorithm is implemented from scratch without the use of machine learning libraries.


Vary the population size and lifespan for interesting results!
